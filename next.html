        <h2>About Shri Badrika Ashram</h2>
        <p>
            The ashram was founded by the venerable saint Om Swami in 2011. After his intense tapas in the Himalayan caves and jungles, Swamiji decided to settle in a valley deep in the lap of Himachal to revive the dormant practices of Dhyana Yoga and Mantra Sadhana. Sri Badrika Ashram is the holy abode of Sri Hari.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sri Badrika Ashram is a nonprofit organization that works towards serving the community at large and the villages that surround it. Swamiji’s simple mantra of, Live, Love, Laugh, Give is the very basis of all endeavors at the ashram. We provide 100% scholarships for students pursuing undergraduate courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            We couple this with mentoring and our team of exceptional mentors come from varied backgrounds ranging from a Supreme Court advocate, professors from IIT & US universities, successful entrepreneurs, doctors, senior academicians from public schools, and more. Mentors are matched to students based on their course of study to not only be successful in their chosen courses but to be effectively placed after graduation. Career counselling will be offered to meritorious students in senior school from Grade 9 to 12 to help them discover their academic strength.
